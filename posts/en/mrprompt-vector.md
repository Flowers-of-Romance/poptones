## Starting point

The earlier study (mrprompt-repro) showed that MRPrompt's "cue-addressable facet recall" is unsupported in-context. Deleting or scrambling the cue keys (cue_phrases) did not move the output, and attention landed on the facet body, not the keys. The reason is simple: because every facet body is in the prompt, the model can pick the needed facet from the body content, and the short key is bypassed. An address only means something when its target is otherwise unreachable.

If that is right, then taking the facet bodies out of the prompt and making the cue the only retrieval path should let the cue-matched facet be recalled. Store facets in an external memory keyed by the cue, and inject only the body whose key matches the dialogue — a retrieval (RAG) setup. We implement this on the same 100 instances, the same Qwen3-8B, and the same scoring as mrprompt-repro, and measure two things.

1. Does the cue, made external, work as an address (did we retrieve the right facet)?
2. Does that retrieve-then-generate beat putting all facets in context (in-context, the competitor the reproduction actually validated) on the final task?

Question 1 is retrieval accuracy; question 2 is task quality. They are different, and the bar for 2 is high. At this scale each character has ~7 facets, which fit in context. Since they fit, handing over a few retrieved facets can be a noisier reduction than handing over all of them.

## Method

- Data: mrprompt-repro's instances_faithful.jsonl (100 instances, 7–8 facets per character, with the cued facet and STM) used as is.
- Retrieval: embed the STM and each facet's key with `BAAI/bge-m3` (multilingual, CLS pooling, bf16/iGPU) and take the cosine nearest neighbour. Three key-richness levels:
  - `cue_only`: cue_phrases only (closest to the paper's "cue keys")
  - `cue_situ`: cue_phrases + situation
  - `body`: situation + emotional_state + behavior_pattern + thinking_pattern (the facet content)
- Generation: inject the retrieved facet body (+ core_traits) into the paper's Magic-If (Fig.19) and generate with Qwen3-8B (thinking-OFF, max_new_tokens=1024, temperature 0.7 / top_p 0.8). All identical to mrprompt-repro, thinking held OFF (so it doesn't mix with the CoT main effect).
- Scoring: single-response adherence (1–10) to the true (cued) facet, with mrprompt-repro's ADH rubric (GPT-4.1-mini, temp 0).
- Baselines (same instances, reused from mrprompt-repro): `allctx` = all facets in context (= the reproduction's mrprompt, adherence 7.43), `base` = prose without facets (7.23).

## Result 1: external, the cue becomes causal — but it is a weak index

Using the STM as query, we retrieve by each facet's key and measure whether the top-1 is the cued facet (n=100, chance@1=0.139 ≈ 7 facets). We compare against a wrongkey condition (the cued facet's key overwritten by a neighbour's, the same operation as mrprompt-repro).

| key | R@1 real | R@1 wrong | R@3 real | R@3 wrong |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cue_only | 0.300 | 0.180 | 0.650 | 0.630 |
| cue_situ | 0.330 | 0.220 | 0.700 | 0.530 |
| body | 0.350 | 0.160 | 0.670 | 0.470 |

(chance@1=0.139, chance@3=0.418)

- real > wrong for every key. In contrast to in-context, where wrongkey had no effect (mrprompt − wrongkey = +0.03, null), externalizing makes the cue causal: the right key pulls the right body, a wrong key pulls a wrong one.
- But top-1 tops out at 0.350 even with the best key (body). Narrowing the query to the last utterance does not help (the full STM is best). This is not the query choice but the fact that one character's facets are semantically close (chance 0.139 over 7), so discrimination is intrinsically hard. Even using the body itself as the key, only 35% of top-1 are correct.
- Richer keys raise R@1 (cue_only 0.300 → cue_situ 0.330 → body 0.350). That is roughly the top-1 ceiling of retrieval-MRPrompt.

## Result 2: top-k stays "addressing" only paired with a rich key

recall@3 (cued present in the top-3) is 0.65–0.70, clearly above chance@3=0.418: widen to three and the cued facet is in there ~70% of the time. But the causal gap at k=3 (R@3 real − wrong) depends on key richness.

| key | R@3 real − wrong |
|---|---|
| cue_only | +0.02 (≈ null) |
| cue_situ | +0.17 |
| body | +0.20 |

With cue_only at top-3, whether the cue is correct barely matters (a wrong key still retrieves 0.63). The moment k widens, a thin key degrades from "addressing by cue" to "just grabbing three semantically near facets." To use top-3 while keeping the mechanism under test (addressing by cue), the key must be richer.

There is also a key × k interaction: the best R@1 is body (0.350), but the best R@3 is cue_situ (0.700; body 0.670). The optimal key flips with k. In the task evaluation below we use body for top-1 and cue_situ for top-3.

## Result 3: on the final task — can retrieve-then-generate beat all-facets-in-context?

So far this is "did we retrieve." The verdict is the final-task adherence (1–10 to the cued facet), on the same 100 instances, thinking OFF, output budget 1024. First the maximum uplift perfect routing could buy: oracle (the true facet injected directly) minus allctx (all facets). If this is near 0, then retrieving correctly equals putting everything in — routing has no value at this scale — settled before we even ask about retriever accuracy.

| condition | adherence |
|---|---|
| base (prose, no facets) | 7.23 |
| allctx (all facets, in-context) | 7.43 |
| oracle (cued facet only) | 7.88 |
| body_top1 (top-1 retrieval, body key) | 7.46 |
| cuesitu_top3 (top-3 retrieval, cue_situ key) | 7.50 |

- oracle − allctx = +0.45 ±0.14 (n=100, ~3.3 SEM). Against the prediction, it is not 0. Injecting only the correct facet beats injecting all seven. In all-facets, the other six act as faint distractors and blunt the alignment. So selection does have value at this scale — perfect routing leaves +0.45 on the table.
- But retrieval does not beat allctx. body_top1 − allctx = +0.03 ±0.16, cuesitu_top3 − allctx = +0.07 ±0.17, both null. It stops short of the ceiling (+0.45).
- The reason is routing accuracy. Split adherence by whether retrieval was correct and it is bimodal:

| condition | when hit | when miss |
|---|---|---|
| body_top1 | 7.74 (n=35) | 7.31 (n=65) |
| cuesitu_top3 | 7.61 (n=70) | 7.23 (n=30) |

On a hit it lands near oracle (7.6–7.7), on a miss near base (7.2–7.3). The average ties allctx because the hit/miss weighting (35–70% hit) lands exactly there. The bottleneck is routing accuracy, not the value of the facet: with only 35% top-1 / 70% top-3 correct (one character's facets are semantically close), the +0.45 ceiling is out of reach.

Finally, the causality of the cue at the adherence level. Comparing cue_only top-1 with its wrongkey: extcue − wrongkey = +0.23 ±0.14, against in-context's mrprompt − wrongkey = +0.03 (null), with real(0.30) > wrong(0.18) at the routing level too. Weak, but external, the right key pulls the right body.

## Takeaways

1. In-context (mrprompt-repro): the cue is inert. With the body fully in context, it is bypassed.
2. External (this study): the cue becomes causal (extcue − wrongkey = +0.23; real > wrong in routing). And injecting only the correct facet beats all-facets by +0.45 — selection itself has value. Fitting in context does not mean dumping everything is best.
3. But current retrieval cannot realize that value. One character's facets are semantically close, so even with the body as the key, top-1 caps at 35% and top-3 at 70%. Adherence splits into near-oracle on a hit and near-base on a miss, and the average ties all-facets (null). The bottleneck is routing accuracy, not the value of selection.

The resolution is two regimes. When facets fit in context, adding retrieval only ties all-facets (and routing is hard to get right), so plain all-facets + CoT is fine. Retrieval starts to pay when (a) you can raise routing accuracy (keys/embeddings that discriminate near-neighbour facets), or (b) facets no longer fit in context — there all-facets is off the table and retrieval, however coarse, becomes necessary. The +0.45 ceiling shows the headroom worth chasing in that case is real.

Caveat: allctx (7 facets) has a longer input than body_top1/cuesitu_top3, so a length asymmetry could enter the quality gap. But oracle (1 facet) beats allctx (7 facets) by +0.45 with a shorter context, so length works against the shorter conditions; the ceiling is not explained by context length. Scoring is GPT-4.1-mini adherence and inherits judge bias. Single model (Qwen3-8B), 100 instances, Chinese characters — preliminary.
